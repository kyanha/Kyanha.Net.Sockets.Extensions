Use the dynamic language runtime to minimize unsafe code between SockaddrStorage4 and SockaddrStorage6.

Figure out how to create SockaddrStorage[46] structures from the list of nominated Sources.
Figure out how to query the list of Sources and recreate the list (WSAIoctl).

Write tests for the operation (not yet necessarily correct operation) of the setsockopt calls.

Figure out what needs to be rewritten to run it on Linux, and abstract it out (like SocketPal_Windows versus SocketPal_Unix).
